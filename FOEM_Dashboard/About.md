#### Analytic Tool for Freight Operational Efficiency Metric

This work will include support for activities as required by the 21st Century Truck Partnershipâ€™s Operational Efficiency Technical Team.  
Specifically, this work will: 
1) provide input to refine the logistics model framework, including definition of the model segments (description, domain, customers, vehicles, applicable emerging technologies, and efficiency metrics); 
2) develop tools for first order approximations of segment and overall system energy and efficiency, obtain necessary data, and estimate baseline performance metrics; 
3) using estimation tools, perform analysis to support roadmap development through establishment of quantitative segment goals; 
4) coordinate with other Tech Team working groups and provide data and analytical support to ensure consistency of assumptions across teams and roadmaps; and 
5) support communication with fleet representatives and external contacts to obtain input and feedback.
