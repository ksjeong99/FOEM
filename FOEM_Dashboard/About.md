### Analytical Tool for Exploring Truck Freight Operational Efficiency

This tool was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for the Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technologies Office to support road-mapping efforts of the 21st Century Truck Partnership’s (21CTP) Freight Operational Efficiency Technology Team (FOETT).

The Freight Operational Efficiency Metrics (FOEM) tool is to provides a segment- and system-level analysis based on a logistics model framework, with truck operations in first-mile, local-regional, long-haul, and last-mile segments. This tool provides first order approximations through 2050 of segment and overall system energy, cost, and emissions metrics for a baseline case and several future scenarios that explore higher efficiency technologies. Wherever appropriate, these scenarios use assumptions consistent with those used by other 21 CTP Technology Teams and working groups.  Powertrain scenarios include achievement of electrified powertrain goals established by the 21CTP Electrification Technology Team. Diesel and electrified vehicle attributes, including component sizing, cost, and fuel efficiency, were provided by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).

While there are limitations to the approach, methodology, and assumptions used in the FOEM, it provides a useful exploratory tool to understand the relative magnitude of impact of a range of future freight efficiency technologies across several key metrics.
